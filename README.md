# ChemEquilib

main.m - the primary code that iterates equilibrium problem until convergence is reached.
readJANAF.m - reads JANAF thermochemical tables from tab-deliminated .txt files
thermoChemEquilib.m - the workhorse code containing all the equations to solve equilibrium problem

Chemical Equilibrium Project Outline.docx - an outline of our thought-process on the project problem and solutions
chemical_equilibrium_Seitzman.pdf - notes from Seitzman's combustion course website, effectively step-by-step solving problem
